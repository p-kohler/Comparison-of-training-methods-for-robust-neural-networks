# Comparison-of-training-methods-for-robust-neural-networks
This repository provides the corresponding code for my bachlor thesis. 
The topic is "Comparison of training methods for robust neural networks - Robustness certification via Lipschitz constants".
I wrote my thesis at the Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control (IST) at the University of Stuttgart,
